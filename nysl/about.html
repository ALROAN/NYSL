        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods,
          who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with
          opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of
          soccer, especially those skills related to team cooperation and good
          sportsmanship.
        </p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
          well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of character,
          self-discipline, and leadership.
        </p>

        <h2>General Info</h2>
        <p>
          The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment
          to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between
          the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL
          is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous
          volunteer time of parents and former league members.
